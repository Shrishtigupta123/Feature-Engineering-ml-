        "1.What is a parameter?\n",
        "A parameter is a variable or value that is used to define or influence a function, method, or process. It acts as a way to pass information or data into a system to modify its behavior or outcome. Parameters are commonly used in various fields, including programming, mathematics, and science.\n",
        "Here are a few examples:\n",
        "1.\tIn Programming: A parameter is an input to a function or method. For example, in the Python function def add(a, b):, a and b are parameters. When you call add(2, 3), the values 2 and 3 are passed into the function as arguments for a and b, respectively.\n",
        "2.\tIn Mathematics: A parameter can be a constant or variable that characterizes a family of equations. For instance, in the equation of a line y=mx+cy = mx + cy=mx+c, mmm and ccc are parameters that define the slope and the y-intercept of the line.\n",
        "3.\tIn Science/Engineering: Parameters are values that describe properties of a system, like the temperature, pressure, or volume of a gas.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is correlation?\n",
        "•\tCorrelation measures the relationship between two variables, indicating whether and how strongly they are related. A positive correlation means that as one variable increases, the other also increases. A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. Correlation values range from -1 (perfect negative) to +1 (perfect positive), with 0 indicating no correlation.\n",
        "3. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "•\tNegative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. For example, if the temperature rises, the number of people wearing coats might decrease, showing a negative correlation.\n",
        "4. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
        "•\tMachine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence where computers learn from data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. The main components are:\n",
        "o\tData: Raw input that the model will learn from.\n",
        "o\tModel: The algorithm used to learn patterns from the data.\n",
        "o\tLoss Function: Measures how well the model performs.\n",
        "o\tOptimizer: Helps minimize the loss by adjusting the model.\n",
        "o\tEvaluation Metrics: Used to assess the model’s performance (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).\n",
        "5.How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "•\tThe loss function measures how well the model's predictions match the actual outcomes. A low loss value means the model is performing well, while a high loss value suggests the model is making many errors and needs improvement.\n",
        "6. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "•\tContinuous variables are numerical variables that can take any value within a range (e.g., height, weight, temperature).\n",
        "•\tCategorical variables represent categories or groups (e.g., color, gender, or brand names). They may be nominal (no inherent order, like \"red\" or \"blue\") or ordinal (with an order, like \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\").\n",
        "7. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        "•\tEncoding categorical variables is crucial for ML models to understand them:\n",
        "o\tOne-Hot Encoding: Converts each category into a binary vector (1s and 0s) representing the presence or absence of each category.\n",
        "o\tLabel Encoding: Converts each category into a numeric value.\n",
        "o\tBinary Encoding: Combines elements of both one-hot and label encoding.\n",
        "8.. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        "•\tTraining: The dataset used to train the model and adjust its parameters.\n",
        "•\tTesting: A separate dataset used to evaluate the model's performance after training.\n",
        "9.. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        "•\tsklearn.preprocessing is a module in the scikit-learn library that contains functions for data preprocessing, such as scaling, encoding, and transforming data into a format suitable for machine learning models.\n",
        "10.. What is a Test set?\n",
        "•\tA test set is a portion of the dataset that is used to evaluate the performance of a model after it has been trained. The test set is not used in training, ensuring the model’s ability to generalize to unseen data.\n"
